### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Caio



I'm a 23 years old Game Programmer which love video games and here goes some facts about me:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Triplano as a Unity developer.

ðŸŒ± I'm always looking forward to learn something new and become a better developer.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open to talk about anything, specially if it's something related to game development, animation, movies and... well, anything lol.

ðŸ’¬ I'm from Brazil, so my main language is Portuguese, but can speak English pretty well (imo).
