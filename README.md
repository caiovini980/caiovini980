### Hi there 👋, I'm Caio


I'm a Game Programmer for about 3 years now:

🔭 I’m currently working at Kokku Games as a Game Developer, learning a lot of new things.

👯 I’m always open to talk about anything, specially if it's something related to games, animation, movies or cooking. 

🐈 I have a cat.

✈️Love to travel to eat different foods and meet new cultures. Countries I've visited: Brazil, Germany, Canada, US, Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Portugal.

🎯 My goal is to work on games I'd love playing, so I'm always looking for to make my games as fun as I wish they should be.

💬 I'm from Brazil, so my mother language is Portuguese but feel free to reach me in English as well.
