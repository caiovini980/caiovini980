### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Caio



I'm a 22 years old Computer Engineer which love video games and I'm currently working on some personal projects on Unity. 
Actually learning Unity3D, ReactJS and NodeJS. Also, I have some knowledge of Scrum and Project Management.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Yami, a 2D metroidvanian game at Tumultuous Productions, as a Unity developer.

ðŸŒ± I'm looking forward to become a Gameplay Programmer in some years.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Unity projects and other opportunities.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Game Development, specially Game Programming so we can learn together.
If you have any suggestions, I will be happy to hear them.
