### Hi there 👋, I'm Caio



I'm a 22 years old Computer Engineer which love games and is currently learning Unity3D to make then. 
Actually studying ReactJS and NodeJS and I have some knowledge of Scrum and Project Management.

🔭 I’m currently working on QRUP, a ecologial product that wants to reduce the amount of plastic cups in the cities, as a backend developer.

🌱 I'm looking forward to become a Gameplay Programmer in some years.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Unity3D projects and join a team.

💬 Ask me about Game Development, specially Game Programming so we can learn together.
If you have any suggestions, I will be happy to hear than.
