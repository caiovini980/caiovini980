### Hi there 👋, I'm Caio



I'm a 22 years old Computer Engineer which love video games and I'm currently working on Triplano as a Unity Developer, Yami and some personal projects. 
Actually learning animation principles. Also, I have some knowledge of Scrum and Project Management.

🔭 I’m currently working on Yami, a 2D metroidvanian game at Tumultuous Productions, and on Triplano as a Unity developer.

🌱 I'm looking forward to become a great Gameplay Programmer and game developer in some years.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Unity and animation projects and other opportunities.

💬 Ask me about C# programming, Game Development in general, animation and culinary so we can learn together.
If you have any suggestions, I will be happy to hear them.
